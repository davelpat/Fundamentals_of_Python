"""
Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to buy LP record albums.
The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 a night.

Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video can use to
calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals.

The program should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total cost.

An example of the program input and output is shown below:

Enter the number of new videos: 3
Enter the number of oldies: 2

The total cost is $13.0

# Cost of different types in dollars
newCost = 3.00
oldCost = 2.00

newVids = int(input("Enter the number of new videos: "))
oldVids = int(input("Enter the number of oldies: "))

newSubtotal = newVids * newCost
oldSubtotal = oldVids * oldCost
totalCost = newSubtotal + oldSubtotal

print("The total cost is $"+ str(totalCost))
