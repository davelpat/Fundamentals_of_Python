"""
You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge.

Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints the cubeâ€™s surface area as output.

An example of the program input and output is shown below:

Enter the cube's edge: 4

The surface area is 96 square units.
"""

edge = int(input("Enter the cube's edge: "))
print("The surface area is", edge**2*6, "square units.")
