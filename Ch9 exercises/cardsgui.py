Instructions for programming Exercise 9.9

Computer card games are more fun if you can see the images of the cards in a
window, as shown in the screen shot in Figure 9-8.

Assume that the 52 images for a deck of cards are in a DECK folder, with the
file naming scheme <rank number><suit letter>.gif. Thus, for example, the image
for the Ace of Hearts is in a file named 1h.gif, and the image for the King of
Spades is in a file named 13s.gif. Furthermore, there is an image file named
b.gif for the backside image of all the cards.

This will be the cardâ€™s image if its faceup variable is False. Using the
DiceDemo program as a role model, write a GUI program that allows you to deal
and view cards from a deck. Be sure to define a helper method that takes a Card
object as an argument and returns its associated image, and remember to turn the
cards as you deal them.
