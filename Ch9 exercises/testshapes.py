Instructions for programming Exercise 9.10

Geometric shapes can be modeled as classes. Develop classes for line segments,
circles, and rectangles in the shapes.py file. Each shape object should contain
a Turtle object and a color that allow the shape to be drawn in a Turtle
graphics window (see Chapter 7 for details).

Factor the code for these features (instance variables and methods) into an
abstract Shape class. The Circle, Rectangle, and Line classes are all subclasses
of Shape. These subclasses include the other information about the specific
types of shapes, such as a radius or a corner point and a draw method.

Then write a script called testshapes.py that uses several instances of the
different shape classes to draw a house and a stick figure.
