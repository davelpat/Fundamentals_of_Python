Instructions for programming Exercise 10.1

Redo the producer/consumer program so that it allows multiple consumers. Each
consumer must be able to consume the same data before the producer produces more
data.

The program should

Print the message Consumer # starting up, where # is the number of the consumer
starting from 0. The producer will set the data as many times as there are
accesses, giving each consumer thread a chance to access the data each time. The
producer should set the data to 1 intially, and then increment it for each
additional access. After each consumer has consumed the data for each access,
print the message Consumer # is done consuming, where # is the number of the
consumer starting from 0. A sample program execution is shown below. Note that
the order of the consumer start ups and accesses may vary with each program
execution.

Enter the number of consumers: 2
Enter the number of accesses: 3
Starting the threads
Producer starting up
Consumer 0 starting up
Consumer 1 starting up
Producer setting data to 1
Consumer 1 accessing data 1
Consumer 0 accessing data 1
Producer setting data to 2
Consumer 0 accessing data 2
Consumer 1 accessing data 2
Producer setting data to 3
Producer is done producing
Consumer 0 accessing data 3
Consumer 0 is done consuming
Consumer 1 accessing data 3
Consumer 1 is done consuming
