Instructions for programming Exercise 8.5

Write a GUI-based program that plays a guess-the-number game in which the roles
of the computer and the user are the reverse of what they are in the Case Study
of this chapter. In this version of the game, the computer guesses a number
between 1 and 100 and the user provides the responses. The window should display
the computerâ€™s guesses with a label. The user enters a hint in response, by
selecting one of a set of command buttons labeled Too small, Too large, and
Correct. When the game is over, you should disable these buttons and wait for
the user to click New game, as before.
